# Vinyl_Collection

DBMS Project. Vinyl Collection

- The project is hosted at https://dbms-vinyl-collection.herokuapp.com

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack responsive web-app with redux created for my Database Managment Systems course at Acadia University. It aims to provide users with an interface to update and maintain inventory of their music collections.

To install and run the dev environment:

- To install dependencies, navigate to main folder "Vinyl_Collection" in either command prompt or terminal window and enter "npm install". Navigate to the "client" directory and enter "npm install" again.

- To launch React app, using a terminal or comannd prompt, navigate to the directory containing all project files(Vinyl_Collection) and type "npm run dev". This should launch the app and open a browser window to access the site at localhost:3000. For best results, use Google Chrome to navigate the site.

Note: All code has been included in this submission, including pieces that were ultimately not used in the final app.
